This repository demonstrates a common error in ActionScript: forgetting to handle null object references. The `bug.as` file contains code that attempts to access a property of a null object. This leads to a runtime error. The `bugSolution.as` file provides a corrected version that checks for null before accessing the object's property.  This is a critical concept in robust ActionScript development.
